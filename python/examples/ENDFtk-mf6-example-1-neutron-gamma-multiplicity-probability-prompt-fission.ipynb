    "# Prompt fission neutron and gamma multiplicity probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "As of the latest release of the ENDF/B-VIII.0 nuclear data library, a new format was introduced to incorporate evaluated data on the prompt fission neutron and gamma multiplicity probability distributions. Previous releases of the library only included the average prompt fission neutron multiplicity, $\\overline{\\nu}$, as a function of the incident energy of the neutron. This data is stored in MF1 MT456 for the average prompt multiplicity, MF1 MT455 for the average delayed multiplicity, and MF1 MT452 for the average total multiplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with ENDF/B-VIII.0, the full multiplicity distributions, P$(\\nu)$ and P$(N_\\gamma$, for neutrons and gammas respectively, are stored in MF6 MT18 as a function of the incident neutron energy. Normally, an MF6 section will only contain a single subsection for each outgoing particle type. In the case of the multiplicity distributions, an MF6 MT18 section can contain more than one neutron reaction product and more than one gamma reaction product.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can thus retrieve all neutron and gamma reaction products from an MF6 MT18 section by filtering over all reaction products given in the section. The reaction product identifier for neutrons and gammas in ENDF are respectively 1 and 0. In the following example, we filter on the reaction products using Python's list comprehension method for the ENDF/B-VIII.0 evaluation for incident neutrons on ${}^{239}$Pu."

    "For normal reaction products found in an MF6 section, the data given for a single reaction product consists of a tabulated multiplicity of the reaction product along with optional outgoing angle and energy distribution data. Multiplicity distributions P$(\\nu)$ and P(N$_\\gamma$) for fission are stored in the same structure, but the data actually has to be interpreted slightly differently. This leads to what many users will see as a rather non-intuitive interface. A higher-abstraction interface for such quantities is being developed as part of a future version of ENDFtk, illustrating the adaptability of the ENDFtk.\n",

    "The neutron or photon multiplicity (which will be an integer value, as the reaction product represents the emission of a number of neutrons or photons) is stored in the `LIP` or `product_modifier_flag` property. The probability distribution associated with the emission of this number of neutrons or photons is stored where the tabulated multiplicity can be found. This data can be retrieved using the `multiplicity` property."
