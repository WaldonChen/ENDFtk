    "# Manipulating an ENDF file\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to functions to navigate and traverse an ENDF tree, the `ENDFtk.tree` components also provide the necessary functionality to insert, remove or replace pieces of the ENDF file. Often, an evaluator will want to take data from one ENDF tree and add it to another ENDF tree, or even replace data in an ENDF tree with entirely new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ENDFtk.tree.Tape`, `ENDFtk.tree.Material` and `ENDFtk.tree.File` components all provide an `remove(...)` function that allows a user to remove specific pieces of the ENDF tree. `ENDFtk.tree.File` objects in an `ENDFtk.tree.Material` object and `ENDFtk.tree.Section` objects in an `ENDFtk.tree.File`object are supposed to be unique, so the `remove(...)` function will the remove the particular component if it is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is slightly different for `ENDFtk.tree.Material` objects in an `ENDFtk.tree.Tape` object. `ENDFtk.tree.Material` objects with the same material number can actually be present multiple times in an `ENDFtk.tree.Tape` object. This is a rare occurence, and only used for processed ENDF tapes in which the same material can appear at multiple temperatures (this would happen when a user processes the same material at multiple temperatures in a processing code). In this case, the `remove(...)` function will remove any `ENDFtk.tree.Material` that has the given material number from the tree.\n",

    "The `ENDFtk.tree.Material` and `ENDFtk.tree.File` components all provide an `insert(...)` and `insert_or_replace(...)` function, respectively to insert a `ENDFtk.tree.File` and `ENDFtk.tree.Section` (or their parsed equivalent). The difference between the two functions is that the `insert(...)` function will only insert the component if the component was not already present (this will throw an exception in the process), while `insert_or_replace(...)` will remove the existing component (if it is present) and then insert the new one. The `insert(...)` function therefore provides some safety while `insert_or_replace(...)` does not provide any.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the `remove(...)` function, the behaviour for `ENDFtk.tree.Tape` is a special case. This component provides an `insert(...)` and `replace(...)` function. In this case, the `insert(...)` function inserts the material in the ENDF tape tree. If one or more materials with the same material number are already present, the new material is inserted after the materials that are already there. The `replace(...)` function on the other hand also inserts the material in the ENDF tape tree, but if one or more materials are already present with the same material number, the old materials are removed before inserting the new material.\n",
